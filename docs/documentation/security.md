## About

In this section I talk about the security platform.

!!! info
    The information is reduced to maintain security and privacy so there may be processes that are not mentioned, censored information or other information that has been modified for security purposes.

!!! tip
    Also we have an [Auth0 wiki section](https://github.com/Isaaker/Ghost_Simulator_ES/wiki/Auth0)

## Considerations

When developing on our platform and especially when accessing it, please act with caution and in a normal manner as we have security systems that detect unusual patterns and activities on the platform and may block your traffic temporarily or permanently.

It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself.</p> <p>Font: Wikipedia</p>"},{"location":"documentation/flask/#what-we-use-flask","title":"What we use Flask?","text":"<p>In previous versions, the project has used different technologies: HTML, PHP.

We have made this decision even though PHP is a fundamental part of the platform, because we believe that Python will improve the platform in many aspects: Speed, Security, Integration and will give us new ways to develop by integrating this library its own micro web server that although not suitable for production use can be a good opportunity for developers to not have to download an additional web server.</p>"},{"location":"documentation/flask/#security-considerations","title":"Security Considerations","text":"<p>Although Flask is a much more secure library than PHP and is more resistant to some code infection or XSS attacks, it is important to take certain security considerations into account.

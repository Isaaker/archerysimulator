We have made this decision even though PHP is a fundamental part of the platform, because we believe that Python will improve the platform in many aspects: Speed, Security, Integration and will give us new ways to develop by integrating this library its own micro web server that although not suitable for production use can be a good opportunity for developers to not have to download an additional web server.</p>"},{"location":"documentation/flask/#security-considerations","title":"Security Considerations","text":"<p>Although Flask is a much more secure library than PHP and is more resistant to some code infection or XSS attacks, it is important to take certain security considerations into account.
